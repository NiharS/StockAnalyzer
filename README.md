# StockAnalyzer - Quartic regressive trends with NLP AI for stocks
This project was built at Wildhacks 2014 (Northwestern University) by Pradyuman Vig, Andrew Braun, Krishna Mittal, Harshit Agarwal and Nihar Sheth.

This hack is a way to calculate if a stock price is going to go up or down the following morning using social media and stock history. It displays the three stocks most likely to go up the next day (from the database of stocks given by the Yahoo Finance API). We used APIs and technology from Yahoo Finance, IBM Bluemix, Paypal, MailJet, and dunnhumby for this hack.
